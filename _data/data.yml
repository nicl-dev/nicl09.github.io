        Planning and creating Kubernetes clusters on public Clouds (AWS,GCP,Azure) based on Gitops principles for multiple customers.
        These were partially used as development platforms and partially as high-available production clusters. My job included everything starting from providing the necessary backend and pipelines for the first `git commit` and ending at securing and hardening
        the supply chain and clusters. For example, we are responsible for the billing services of one of Germanys biggest mobile service providers.

        2020 I was given the opportunity to automate our application server installation. That meant automating
        the installation of our own software, corresponding databases and third party applications. The entire project was developed with Ansible and Terraform.

        I was also commissioned to migrate our entire code base from Subversion to Git. We succesfully migrated more than 300 repostiories from SVN to Git.
        We took that opportunity to also move on from Jenkins Jobs to Jenkins Pipelines, including our own Jenkins Library.

        During and after the continuous migration from SVN to Git we also started shifting into the container and Kubernetes world. This meant deploying our legacy applications and administrating a rancher cluster.
          - Kubernetes
          - Helm
          - ArgoCD
          - CI/CD (Maven, Jenkins Library, Groovy, Bash, Nexus)
          - Ansible
          - Building Docker images for our software builds and application servers
          - Grafana/Prometheus monitoring and alerting with Alertmanager
          - Administration of hundreds of application servers (JBoss/Wildfly, WebSphere)
          - Database administration (PostgreSQL, Oracle, DB2)
          - Continuous migration from SVN to Git (Bitbucket) of 1.5M+ commits and more than 300 Git Repositories. Including the entire history and infrastructure (Nexus/Jenkins/Bitbucket etc.)
    - role: Associate IT Consultant

        My first year mainly consisted of learning the internal software development process from scratch. Our team was involved in every part of the process.
        From the first commit and push to the repository, through the following deployment to our artifact repository and the deployment to our and the customers different application servers
        we were responsible for the entire continuous integration.
        We also installed and administrated the different test-, dev- and prod-stages and administrated the entire infrastructure related to our development process and build pipeline.

        I also decided to rebuild our monitoring stack and used a Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager stack for this purpose.
          - Installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting for hundreds of Jboss/Wildfly/WebSphere/Liberty Application Servers on Linux and Windows machines
          - Installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting for PostgresSQL, Oracle and DB2
          - CI Pipelines with Jenkins and SVN
          - Monitoring the infrastructure and alert management with Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana
          - Automated releasing and branching with Maven, Git, SVN, Bash Scripting, Jenkins and Nexus Artefact Repository. Including databases.

  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Hello, and nice to meet you! My name is Niclas. I started my career in IT as an apprentice IT system technician.
    However, my dream was always to move into software development rather than the hardware field of our profession.

    That's why I decided to continue my career at msg nexinsure ag in Hamburg. In my first year at the company I was given
    the opportunity to learn many aspects about software development. This allowed me to discover my passion for the
    DevOps role to which I transitioned to after my first year and it is what I am still happily working as today.

    Currently I am working as a DevOps Engineer for Tallence ag where I am responsible for administrating Kubernetes Clusters in the
    Google Cloud, managed by Terraform and hosted in Gitlab.

      In 2022 I decided to pick up a new opportunity as a DevOps Engineer at Tallence ag. Here I do have the opportunity to expand
      my Cloud knowledge and to dive even further into the Kubernetes world. My current project multiple GKE Clusters on the Google Cloud Platform
      which are all managed by Terraform and ArgoCD. We are running our own Application there but also things like Kafka or a Grafana stack.
        - Google Cloud Platform
        - Kubernetes
        - Terraform
        - ArgoCD
        - Kafka
  - role: DevOps Engineer
    time: 2020 - 2022

      2020 I started shifting into my first DevOps role. I was given the opportunity to automate our application server installation. That meant automating
      the installation of our own software, corresponding databases and a couple of third party applications. The entire project was developed with Ansible.
      These roles are still in use today and our basement for our entire on-premise automation.

      Afterwards I was commissioned to migrate our entire code base from Subversion to Git. We succesfully migrated more than 300 repostiories from SVN to Git.
      We took that opportunity to also move on from Jenkins Jobs to Jenkins Pipelines, including our own Jenkins Library.

      During and after the continuous migration from SVN to Git we also started shifting into the container and Kubernetes world. This meant developing Kubernetes
      manifests and Docker images for our application and administrating a small rancher cluster with a couple of dozen nodes.
        - Development of Kubernetes & Helm manifests
        - ArgoCD
        - Deployment pipeline (Maven, Jenkins Library, Groovy, Bash, Nexus)
        - Ansible automation
        - Continuous integration
        - Branching & Releasing
        - Building Docker images for our software builds and application servers
        - Grafana/Prometheus monitoring and alerting with alert manager
        - Administrating hundreds of application servers (JBoss/Wildfly, WebSphere)
        - Database administration (PostgreSQL, Oracle, DB2)
        - Continuous migration from SVN to Git (Bitbucket) of 1.5M+ commits and more than 300 Git Repositories. Including the entire history and infrastructure (Nexus/Jenkins/Bitbucket etc.)
  - role: Associate IT Consultant
    time: 2019 - 2020
    company: msg nexinsure ag, Hamburg

      My first year mainly consisted of learning the software development process from scratch. Our team was involved in every part of the process. 
      From the first commit and push to the repository, through the following deployment to our artifact repository and the deployment to our different application servers to the delivery to our customers
      we were responsible for the entire continuous integration.
      We also installed and administrated the different test-, dev- and prod-stages and administrated the entire infrastructure related to our development process and build pipeline.

      In the second half of my first year I decided to rebuild our monitoring stack and used a Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager stack for this purpose. This stack is still active
      today and used by more than 400 colleagues.
        - Installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting for hundreds of Jboss/Wildfly/WebSphere/Liberty Application Servers on Linux and Windows machines
        - Installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting for PostgresSQL, Oracle and DB2
        - CI Pipelines with Jenkins and SVN
        - Monitoring the infrastructure and alert management with Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana
        - Automated releasing and branching with Maven, Git, SVN, Bash Scripting, Jenkins and Nexus Artefact Repository. Including databases.

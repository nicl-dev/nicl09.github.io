    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hello and nice to meet you! My name is Niclas. I started my career in IT as an apprentice IT system technician. 
      But my dream was always to move into the software development rather than the hardware field of our profession. 

      That's why I decided to continue my career at msg nexinsure ag in Hamburg. In my first year at the company they gave 
      me the opportunity to learn many aspects about software development. This allowed me to discover my passion for the 
      DevOps role which I transitioned to after my first year.

      After a couple of years in this role I am now looking forward to a new challenge to make the next step in my development.

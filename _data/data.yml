    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hello, and nice to meet you! My name is Niclas. I started my career in IT as an apprentice IT system technician. 
      However, my dream was always to move into the software development rather than the hardware field of our profession. 

      That's why I decided to continue my career at msg nexinsure ag in Hamburg. In my first year at the company I was given 
      the opportunity to learn many aspects about software development. This allowed me to discover my passion for the 
      DevOps role where I transitioned to after my first year.

      After a couple of years in this role I am now looking forward to a new challenge and want to make the next step in my development.
education:
    - degree: IT systems technician

    - role: DevOps Engineer

        2020 I started shifting into more of a DevOps role. I was given the opportunity to automate our application server installation. That meant automating
        the installation of our own software, corresponding databases and a couple of third party applications. The entire project was developed with Ansible. 
        These roles are still in use today and our basement for our entire on-premise automation.

        Afterwards I was commissioned to migrate our entire code base from Subversion to Git. We succesfully migrated more than 300 repostiories from SVN to Git.
        We took that opportunity to also move on from Jenkins Jobs to Jenkins Pipelines, including our own Jenkins Library. 

        During and after the continuous migration from SVN to Git we also started shifting into the container and Kubernetes world. This meant developing Kubernetes
        manifests and Docker images for our application and administrating a small rancher cluster with a couple of dozen nodes.

          - Development of Kubernetes & Helm manifests
          - ArgoCD
          - Deployment pipeline (Maven, Jenkins Library, Groovy, Bash, Nexus)
          - Ansible automation
          - Continuous integration
          - Branching & Releasing
          - Building Docker images for our software builds and application servers
          - Grafana/Prometheus monitoring and alerting with alert manager
          - Administrating hundreds of application servers (JBoss/Wildfly, WebSphere)
          - Database administration (PostgreSQL, Oracle, DB2)
          - Continuous migration from SVN to Git (Bitbucket) of 1.5M+ commits and more than 300 Git Repositories. Including the entire history and infrastructure (Nexus/Jenkins/Bitbucket etc.)
    - role: Associate IT Consultant
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: msg nexinsure ag, Hamburg

        My first year mainly consisted of learning the software development process from scratch. Our team was involved in every part of the process. 
        From commit and push to the repository, the continuous integration, through artifact repository and app server deployment to delivery to the customer.
        We also installed and administrated the different test, dev and prod stages and administrated the entire infrastructure related to the development process.
        
        In the second half of my first year I decided to rebuild our monitoring stack and used a Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager stack for this purpose. This stack is still active
        today and used by more than 400 colleagues.  
          - Installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting for hundreds of Jboss/Wildfly/WebSphere/Liberty Application Servers on Linux and Windows machines
          - Installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting for PostgresSQL, Oracle and DB2
          - CI Pipelines with Jenkins and SVN
          - Monitoring the infrastructure and alert management with Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana
          - Automated releasing and branching with Maven, Git, SVN, Bash Scripting, Jenkins and Nexus Artefact Repository. Including databases.
    - role: IT systems technician
      time: 2015 - 2019

        During my 4 years at the company I was responsible for the administration of the Windows office infrastructure.

          - Windows administration
          - Factory network supervision
          - Vectron cash system administration and installation (remote and in person)
          - Succesfully transitioned the entire office infrastructure from Windows to Igel OS virtual desktops (finals project)
